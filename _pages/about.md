I am an aspiring data scientist, experienced in Python and R programming with a postgraduate degree in theoretical Physics and M.Sc. in Data Analytics. 
I specialise in machine learning techniques and data wrangling. I love statistics and statistical learning - please reach out if you have a nice DS project and you are looking for collaboration!
